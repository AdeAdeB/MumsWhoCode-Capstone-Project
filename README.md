# MumsWhoCodeSQL_project

## Project/Goals
## Project description
This is the capstone project after an intensive 2-months training at MumsWhoCode.
We were taught on how to use excel, power bi, and SQL for data analysis.
## Goals
1- To be able to use SQL for data exploration and cleaning as a data analyst
2- To navigate GitHub repositories and be familiar with them
3- To build my first ever portfolio and showcase my work to the world
## Process

Step 1- pgAdmin was lauched and the database was created
Step 2- captown_air_bnb table was created using the query tool
Step 3- the file is a csv file so it was imported to pgAdmin using the import data option
Step 4- there are a lot of null values in the datset, so another table was created using the *SELECT INTO* function while keeping the original table

## Results
(fill in what you discovered the data could tell you  and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges

Importing the csv file brought a lot of failed processes because the OID option was checked
Cleaning the null values, don't know whether to filter them out or replace them with a default value
There are some unnecessary data in some columns

## Future Goals

(What would you do if you had more time?)
