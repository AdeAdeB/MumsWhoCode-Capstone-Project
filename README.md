# MumsWhoCodeSQL_project

## Project/Goals
## Project description
This is the capstone project after an intensive 2-months training at MumsWhoCode.
We were taught on how to use excel, power bi, and SQL for data analysis.
## Goals
1- To be able to use SQL for data exploration and cleaning as a data analyst
2- To navigate GitHub repositories and be familiar with them
3- To build my first ever portfolio and showcase my work to the world
## Process

Step 1- pgAdmin was lauched and the database was created
Step 2- captown_air_bnb table was created using the query tool
Step 3- the file is a csv file so it was imported to pgAdmin using the import data option
Step 4- there are a lot of null values in the datset, so another table was created using the *SELECT INTO* function while keeping the original table
Step 5- dropped unwanted columns

## Results
The data could tell us a lot about the CapeTown Air BnB such as:
1) The number of listing each host has
2) The host with the highest number of listings
3) The booking frequency
4) The status of a host's activeness
5) The general rating
6) The price comparison
7) The correlation between the review and the pricing
8) The host performance in correlation with the rating
9) The minimum and maximum nights that can be spent
10) The hosts' location

## Challenges

Importing the csv file brought a lot of failed processes because the OID option was checked
Cleaning the null values, don't know whether to filter them out or replace them with a default value- Created a new table dropping the null values while keeping the original table intact
There are some unnecessary data in some columns
Finding it difficult to split the unnecessary data from the column
Using the price for an aggregate function was difficult because it was in character varying type- Overcame the challenge by writing some code

## Future Goals

If I had more time, I'd explore the data more and create new columns.
After the submission of the project, I'll torture the data more.
