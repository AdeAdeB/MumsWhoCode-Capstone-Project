# MumsWhoCodeSQL_project

## Project/Goals
## Project description
This is the capstone project after an intensive 2-months training at MumsWhoCode.


We were taught on how to use excel, power bi, and SQL for data analysis.
## Goals
1- To be able to use SQL for data exploration and cleaning as a data analyst


2- To navigate GitHub repositories and be familiar with them


3- To add this project to my portfolio as a case study
## Process

Step 1- pgAdmin was lauched and the database was created


Step 2- captown_air_bnb table was created using the query tool


Step 3- the file is a csv file so it was imported to pgAdmin using the import data option


Step 4- the datset was cleaned thoroughly by replacing the null values with default values and dropping redundant columns

## Results
The data could tell us a lot about the CapeTown Air BnB such as:
1) The number of listing each host has
2) The host with the highest number of listings
3) The booking frequency
4) The status of a host's activeness
5) The general rating
6) The price comparison
7) The correlation between the review and the pricing
8) The host performance in correlation with the rating
9) The minimum and maximum nights that can be spent
10) The hosts' location

## Challenges

Importing the csv file brought a lot of failed processes because the OID option was checked


Cleaning the null values, don't know whether to filter them out or replace them with a default value- Later replaced the null values with default values


There are some unnecessary data in some columns


Using the price for an aggregate function was difficult because it was in character varying type- Overcame the challenge by casting the price column

## Future Goals

Using SQL more in cleaning and exploring datasets.
